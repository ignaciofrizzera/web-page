From data selection, filtering and normalization, to model selection, training and finally their use on predictions. At the end of 2021, I started developing in the frontend as well. Technologies used for backend: Python, Pandas, MySQL, Django, Django-Restframework, and asynchronous programming tools like Django Q. For the frontend I used Typescript and Angular.",
